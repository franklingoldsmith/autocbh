# This file contains the rankings for different levels of theory.
# It uses the same ranking as RMG for uniformity:

# 
# Rank  | Example Methods
# 1     | Experiment/FCI
# 2     | W4/HEAT with very good (2-d if necessary) rotors
# 3     | CCSD(T)-F12/cc-PVnZ with n>2 or CCSD(T)-F12/CBS with good (2-d if necessary) rotors
# 4     | CCSD(T)-F12/DZ, with good (2-d if necessary) rotors
# 5     | CBS-QB3 with 1-d rotors
# 6     | Double-hybrid DFT with 1-D rotors
# 7     | Hybrid DFT (w/ dispersion) (rotors if necessary)
# 8     | B3LYP & lower DFT (rotors if necessary)
# 9     | Group Additivity
# 10    | Direct Estimate/Guess
# 11    | Average of Rates
# 0     | General Estimate (Never used in generation)
